i) The product objectives describe what the product (website) owners want to get from the site.


Website: CoffeePlus - an online ordering website for espresso coffees for CBD businesses. Order online, Save time.
The customer will be able to create an online account, log on and order from a range of coffee products, state quantity and delivery location.  They're provided real time online tracking for delivery ETA so they can plan when to order.

The customer is able to save preferred coffee type and quantities for faster decision making process (i.e. one click delivery button).

Payment is made via secure payment gateway using the customers credit card (e.g. Stripe).

In order to determine profitability, a minimum order quantity will have to be figured out.  Perhaps 4 coffees minimum per order?  Also as a minimum viable product the service can only be utilised within a 15Km radius of inner wellington CBD (where the coffee shop is located).  If the business hits off and revenues start coming in, then other sites may be setup.







PRODUCT OBJECTIVES:

1) SPEED, CONVENIENCE:
Instead of the traditional model of physically having to walk to a coffee shop, order coffees and wait for coffees to be made, the customer can order simply online with their own secure account and have the coffees delivered to their workplace within 20 minutes of ordering.

    - Metrics: User adoption rates, rate of returning customers, average real speed of delivery per order vs estimated time.


2) SOCIAL:
CoffeePLus endeavours to be a social enterprise model, only sourcing the highest quality beans from fairtrade, organic farmers and paying a fair price.

    - Metrics: Volume of fairtrade beans bought, number of fairtrade coffee suppliers partnered with.

3) COFFEE AWARENESS:
We aim to make the drinking of espresso coffee a mainstay of people who aren't coffee lovers by making it easier and more accessible to the average customer.  By removing the barriers of time, inconvenience, our target customers are able to start drinking espresso with ease.

    -Metrics:User adoption rates, rate of returning customers, transparent review system of each coffee type on website.



4)GROWTH: Achieve sustainable and even levels of growth of users to the website, with returning customers being of prime importance (it's known that it's easier to attract returning customers, then try to get new ones).
Once the MVP has taken off to sustainable revenue/profitability and cashflow levels, we will look into planning to expand to a greater radius (currently 15km of our base) - perhaps 20-30km?  This will enable us to increase our customer base, bring in more revenue and introduce more customers to our value proposition of fast, convenient coffee.

    -metrics: User adoption rates, rate of returning customers, traffic to the website, average order size, average revenue per order, bounce rate on website, number of reviews of coffee products.
