 list potential site audiences (e.g., customers) in order of decreasing importance. 

 Under each audience list the needs of that audience, again in order of decreasing importance, along with the reasons for each and how your site will meet them


 1) Customers, including potential ones.  For obvious reasons as they provide the revenue to sustain the business.
 

          Reasons:
          - A) fast, convenient coffee delivery. Why? Busy people in the workplace don't want to waste time commuting, waiting for coffee.  They want to be outsource this tedious task by being able to simply purchase online and have someone else deliver it and do the running around. We meet that need with our website desktop and mobile app with real time delivery timeframes.

          B) A great tasting coffee: Obvious reason as no one wants to buy something that doesn't meet their taste preferences.  Our site will meet this by both having time tested baristas who have a proven track record of making great coffee, and also as mentioned, sourcing from high quality organic free trade suppliers.




2) Employees: Those that work closely within the business will want to know how well the app is meeting the objectives of providing a good user experience for the customer.  Common sense says that a happy employee is a productive one so it makes sense to order this as a high priority.

          Reasons:
          - A) Product-Market fit: Is the website created and designed in a way that meets the actual needs of the end user?  Does it solve the pain points that the target market is wanting to be solved closely?  Is the end user wanting specific features to be added or removed in order to enhance their experience.

          -B) Integrity: Employees want to feel that the product that they're involved with aligns with the value it provides to the customer and society.  Does this business model solve a real pain point that people are willing to actually pay for it, instead of something that is a 'fad'.  Does the business adhere to fair trade practises and is transparent with this on the website?


3) Media:  They can help promote the business through reviews of the user experience, interviews regarding the model of coffee delivery.  In doing so help provide free advertising that'll attract potential customers.
          
          Reasons:
          - A) Free Promotion: Paid advertising can be an expensive medium to invest in to get paid customers.  By having the media used as an 'impartial' reviewer of the service, it could attract the trust and attention of potential customers.  In doing so, therefore would save money on initial outlay costs which would best be served on running the business.

          B) Can act as initial test users who then can spread the word and refer other businesses they associate with to use the service.  An excellent place for word of mouth referrals.


4) Competitors:  Those who already have established coffee businesses will want to be aware of others who could cut into their market share and disrupt their brick and mortar business model.

          Reasons:
          - A) Market Share: If established competitors find that CoffeePlus is taking off and taking revenue/market share away from them then they may consider cloning this business model to compete with directly or add it as an additional service offering in order to protect themselves.
          - B) Ideas: Competitors may be interested in what aspects of CoffeePlus are revolutionary and implement that in their business model.  E.G. having an app to communicate with customers, using fairtrade coffee and sourcing from similar suppliers, good UX design of website to project a good image to customers etc.
