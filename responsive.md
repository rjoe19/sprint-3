 
Defining Responsive Design
Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. RWD is one approach to the problem of designing for the multitude of devices available to customers, ranging from tiny phones to huge desktop monitors.

RWD uses so-called breakpoints to determine how the layout of a site will appear: one design is used above a breakpoint and another design is applied below that breakpoint. The breakpoints are commonly based on the width of the browser.


- Optimize text for reading
Classic readability theory suggests that an ideal column should contain 70 to 80 characters per line (about 8 to 10 words in English). Thus each time the width of a text block grows past about 10 words, a breakpoint should be considered.


-Never completely hide content
Be careful when choosing what content to hide or show depending on screen size. Don’t simply hide content just because you can’t fit it on screen. Screen size is not a definitive indication of what a user may want. For example, eliminating the pollen count from the weather forecast could be a serious issue for spring time allergy sufferers who need the information to determine if they can go outside or not (re weather app iphone)




        (Deferring secondary content for mobile)

          -Mobile devices require a tight focus in content presentation, with the first screen limited to only the most essential information.


          Deferring Information = Initial Info Read More
          It's a tough decision to defer most of your information to secondary screens because many users will never see it, even though you no doubt consider it very important.

          But remember: if you make the first screen too dense, then nobody will read anything. Better to focus the initial screen and let those users who're particularly interested dig into the rest. That way, you'll satisfy more customers, get more traffic, and derive more business value from your mobile conte



********TL;DR**********
Create breakpoints based on content, never on specific devices, products, or brands.
Design for the smallest mobile device first, then progressively enhance the experience as more screen real estate becomes available.
Keep lines of text to a maximum of around 70 or 80 characters.








 List the key features and benefits of responsive design as you see them. 

 Feature: The same HTML is served to all devices, using CSS (which determines the layout of webpage) to change the appearance of the page. 
      Benefit is a single codebase can support users with differently sized viewports, hence easier to manage, save time and hassle managing multiple code.

 Feature: In responsive design, page elements reshuffle as the viewport grows or shrinks
      Benefit: No need to specify browser/platform standards in web development.

Feature: It is also possible to hide certain items — such as background images,  secondary content or supplementary navigation — on smaller screens. 
      Benefit: cater website to different users and their respective needs.





 What advantages would building a single, responsive website have over buidling multiple targeted applications, either individual web apps or separate apps for, for example, iOS, Android, etc.? 

- RWD has potential advantages over developing separate sites for different device types. The use of a single codebase can make development faster, compared to developing 3 or 4 distinct sites, and makes maintenance easier over time, as one set of code and content needs to be updated rather than 3 or 4. RWD is also relatively “future-proof” in that it can support new breakpoints needed at any time. If a 5-inch device or 15-inch device takes off in the market, the code can support the new devices. RWD doesn’t tie design to a particular device.



 What advantages may native apps have?
 - Because native apps are written for a specific platform, they can interact with and take advantage of operating system features and other software that is typically installed on that platform. Because a native app is built for a particular device and its operating system, it has the ability to use device-specific hardware and software, meaning that native apps can take advantage of the latest technology available on mobile devices such as a global positioning system (GPS) and camera

 - Depending on the nature of the native app, Internet connectivity may not be required. 

 - A mobile app will provide users with unique functionality and speed that can’t be achieve with a responsive website, but can be experienced on the operating system you choose to design your app on.





What's your opinion (remembering that your opinion may change many times as you learn more)? Responsive apps or native apps?

- I think that where possible (accounting for time, budget etc) BOTH responsive and native apps should be developed because an optimal experience is achieved.  re Responsive: being able to have a website look good on all platforms regardless of size.  re native apps: being able to utilise the specifics features of a device (e.g. iPhone) if they are required, and hence this would enhance the user experience.
