Give us feedback on what you learned from reading about perceivability, including whether you agree with the information, how important you think it is to web development, and how you see it affecting your approach to web site design. 

Before reading the article, I didn't really know of the importance of making a website accessible to all users as much as possible.  I know realise that it's a basic human right to have access to the same level of information as every other user.  The internet is a medium that helps level the playing field of information and assists in decentralising it.  In saying that, it needs to be accessible to those with certain disabilities such as vision,hearing or touch as part of that decentralising philisophy.


It will make me more conscious about how I go about ensuring that the web design is accessible for all users (or as many as possible).  

I also think that I will have to also take into account practical considerations such as budget, project deadlines and so fourth re implementing POUR and perhaps have to take an 80/20 approach to determine the few key areas to focus that have the biggest impact.




What could you do to make your web sites or applications more perceivable?

- adhere to ARIA roles to make it easier for screen readers 
- google/consult with specialists regarding industry best practises
- Use tools such as spurapp.com to view my website according to different vision impairments (e.g. blury, monochrome) and adjust it accordingly.
